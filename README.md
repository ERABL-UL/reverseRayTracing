# Voxel Occupancy Probability Estimation

The phase of voxel occupancy probability estimation will begin with structuring the point cloud into cubic voxels. We will need to determine the size of the voxels and whether it is necessary to adjust their size based on the density of the point cloud, which varies with the distance to the LiDAR. Next, we will address the voxel occupancy probability. Five occupancy hypotheses will be considered, four of which correspond to empty voxels: occlusion, self-occlusion, opening, and absence of return, while the fifth hypothesis is occupancy. The voxel occupancy probability will be estimated based on different knowledge extracted from the data.

The first approach to knowledge extraction will involve reverse ray tracing. The principle is to evaluate why a voxel is empty by tracing rays from the voxel towards the road in multiple directions. If a ray collides with a non-empty voxel, the associated information (such as its class, coordinates, and the number of points it contains) will contribute to determining the probability of encountering an occlusion source object. The second approach to knowledge extraction will focus on analyzing the neighborhood of voxels. It will involve analyzing information related to non-empty voxels in proximity to an empty voxel and evaluating the probability of self-occlusion based on the predominance of a class in the neighborhood. For both approaches, it will be considered that certain classes are more likely to produce occlusions, such as vegetation and automobiles. It will also be necessary to determine a probability formalism suitable for the extracted knowledge. Occlusions can then be detected based on these probabilities.

We will combine the self-occlusion probabilities from the neighborhood analysis with the occlusion probabilities from the reverse ray tracing analysis to assign an occupancy class to each voxel. Occlusions will be associated with voxels having an occlusion or self-occlusion probability above a predefined threshold. It will be possible to extract characteristics of these occlusion areas, such as their volume, dimensions, location relative to the road, and the class of objects causing them. Such information will be useful for establishing statistics on occlusion occurrence in point clouds in residential and rural environments.

For example, for a given voxel, if an object is located in front of the sensor, it contains no points, and the classification probabilities of its neighbors are strong, it is plausible that the voxel represents an occlusion and that the object in front of the sensor is the cause.
